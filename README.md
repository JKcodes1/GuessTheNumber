# GuessTheNumber

## Guess the number in **6** attempts.

How to use: Download & run the **guess_the_number.py** file and follow the instructions.

When you're ready, type **START**

The program will then generate a number for you to guess, be quick; you'll only have 6 chances to figure it out!

Once you guess the number, the program will tell you if it's spot on, less or more than the selected number. You'll also have details of your number range to help!

If you don't guess in 6 attempts, you'll lose the game and have to start again!

**Good luck!**
