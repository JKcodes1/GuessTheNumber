# GuessTheNumber

Guess the number game

How to use: Run the guess_the_number.py file and follow the instructions. In the future I plan to deploy this on a webpage as well.

When you're ready type START

Programm will then generate a number for you to guess, be quick, you'll only have 10 chances to guess it!

Once you guess the number, the programm will tell you if it's spot on, less or more than the selected number. You'll also have details of your number range to help!

If you don't guess in 10 attemptes, you'll lose the game and will have to start again!

Good luck!
